This is a simple Voice-Controlled Dashboard built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that lets you interact with the web page using natural voice commands. You can change the background or text color, switch fonts, toggle dark/light mode, make the assistant speak custom phrases, show or hide elements, and even ask for the current date â€” all without touching your keyboard or mouse. It's a fun and beginner-friendly project that showcases the power of the Web Speech API in a creative way.
